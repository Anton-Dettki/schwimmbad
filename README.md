This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

For components and styling we are using the newest version of vuetify and schedule-x as the Calendar component.

Each Kita gets their own CalendarId. This makes it easy to de-/select some of them and lets you choose more freely which you want to display.
This will also make it easier to list them later on, since we only have to sort after them.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).
